\chapter{Sonar Simulation}

\epigraph{If you cause your ship to stop, and place the head of a long tube in
the water and place the outer extremity\\ in your ear, you will hear ships at a
great distance from you.}{\textit{Leonardo Da Vinci}, 1490}


The ideia behind simulation is to have a flexible environment where the system
(e.g. sonar, reconstruction model) can be tested on a variety of conditions
and the ground truth is well known. It is a mature and wide spread
mechanism for development of new sonar technologies \cite{Etter2013}.

This chapter start with a small revision on the physics and history behind
sonars, explore the existing technologies and models. Then describes the
envisioned environment properties. And finish with a more detailed view of
the simulation technique used.
