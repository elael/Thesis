\chapter{Sonar Simulation}

\epigraph{If you cause your ship to stop, and place the head of a long tube in
the water and place the outer extremity\\ in your ear, you will hear ships at a
great distance from you.}{\textit{Leonardo Da Vinci}, 1490}


The idea behind simulation is to have a flexible environment where the system
(e.g. sonar, reconstruction model) can be tested on a variety of conditions
and the ground truth is well known. It is a mature and widespread
mechanism for development of new sonar technologies \cite{Etter2013}.

Opening this chapter, it will be presented physical foundations behind sonars,
the existing technologies, and models. Followed by a rich description of
sonar simulation techniques, especially of ray theory based ones, and ending
with characterization of the envisioned environemnt and implementation.
