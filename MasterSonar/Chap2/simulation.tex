\section{Simulation}

Works on \textit{computacional ocean
acoustics}, the subfield of knowledge that explores the algorithms that model
the ocean as an acoustic medium, are well documented by
\citet{Etter2013}.

When constructing a simulation one has to consider the tradeoff between
simplicity/perfomance/accuracy.
