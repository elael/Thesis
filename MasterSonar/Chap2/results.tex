\section{Implementation and Results}

The simulation follow the ray tracing technique outlined by
\citet{bell1997simulation} for side scan sonar, but applies it to a forward
looking sonar imaging sonar (section \ref{ss:avaible_models}). It also uses a
noising adding step as suggested by \citet{coiras2009gpu} with statistics
provided by \citet{maussang2007mean}.
No movement induced distortion was considered, some approachs to add this
feature is available on \citet{bell1999techniques,borawski2005sonar}.

Sonar parameters follow a Tritech's Micron sonar\cite{micronsonar}
information as output power, dynamic gain and sensibility were found on
official Tritech's documentation\cite{micronsonar,micronmodem}. The directional
gain was measured by the National Physical Laboratory, UK.
