%% SJ: add explanations about profiling vs. imaging: size of beam and
%% SJ: implications (ambiguities)

Profiling sonars is the laser scanner analog for underwater mapping,
so most of the approaches on 3D underwater SLAM (\textbf{S}imultateous
\textbf{L}ocalization \textbf{a}nd \textbf{M}apping) focus on applying laser
scanner techniques to profiling sonars, e.g.
%% SJ: they don't really "give more information". They cover more space per
%% SJ: beam, but the information is more ambiguous
point cloud reconstruction. On the other hand, imaging sonars are usually cheaper and gives more information per sound
beam. So having the possibility of using imaging sonar and benefiting from its
%% SJ: "a win-win strategy" means that there are two parties ... I only see one
extra information is a win-win strategy.

%% SJ: apart from poor wording, the following is off the point. What you really
%% SJ: want to stress is that there are various map representations. There are
%% SJ: SLAMs on dense 3D maps / 2.5D ! Not every SLAM is feature-based, and a
%% SJ: lot of feature-based SLAMs can generate dense maps as a byproduct
Besides the definition of the sonar, one should carefully look into the meaning
of mapping, because, it can be interpreted in different ways, depending on the
context.
Taking what they all have in common, it is possible to generically define
mapping as being the process of received environmental data to characterize
the surroundings. The meaning characterization is where the
difference lays, how the environs are going to be represented is dependent on
the application.

On a SLAM system there is no intrinsic need for a human readable map. In such a
system, it may be more interesting to store the map information, the
characterization, only through its most representative features, if that is
what matters for the localization procedure.

Still, if the map is to be seen by a human it should store more information
about the environment, so that it can be displayed as a usual map, 3D or 2D
depending on the case. This representation also guides how the data could be
stored, e.g. if it wants to show a surface, it can be stored as a elevation map,
or if one wants to see a 3D object it can be stored as a point cloud.
