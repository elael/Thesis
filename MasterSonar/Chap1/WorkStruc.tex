\section{Work Structure}

\textbf{Chapter 1}\quad Motivation and general description of the thesis.
\\
\textbf{Chapter 2}\quad Description of sonar models and their working
principle. Development of simulation logic from acoustics. Review of
simulations techniques on the literature. Implementation and results of a
simulator based on a ray theory algorithm.
\\
\textbf{Chapter 3}\quad Presentation of the mathematical structure necessary for
understanding Hilbert Maps.
\\
\textbf{Chapter 4}\quad Review of mapping techniques on the literature.
Detailed description of Hilbert Maps and a proposal of sonar response embbeding.
Implementation and results for a box-like environment, from a simulation of
chapter 2.
\\
\textbf{Chapter 5}\quad Comparison between simulation ground truth and
reconstructed environment. Suggestion of next steps to improve both simulation
and mapping.
