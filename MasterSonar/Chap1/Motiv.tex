%% SJ: you're not doing SLAM, and mapping is important. Period.

The mapping of underwater environments is not just a part of a SLAM system. It
might have importance on its own, it can be used for humans to visualize things
that could not be seeing otherwise. 

In the ROSA (\textit{Robô para Operações de Stoplogs Alagados}) project,
developed by LEAD/COPPETEC for ESBR, one of the goals is to make a reconstruction
of the hydroelectric power plant turbine entrance to spot any underwater debris
that could block the lowering of stoplogs, used to block the water flow, and
then cause delays or even accidents.

%% SJ: AFAIK, you won't run your algorithm on any ESBR data .... I wouldn't
%% SJ: mention it here
Interestingly, the stoplog setup has
characteristics that makes it appropriate for mapping. It has a lifting beam for
inserting the stoplogs into the water that can act as stable fixation point for
any sonar structure, providing a good mean of localization.
Thus data collected there is suitable for testing the mapping
algorithm in a real world environment, as opposed to lab testing.
Although the noise environment might impair greatly the mapping, and subsequent
visual reconstruction.

him to know where it is or/and what he is doing, especially because cameras do

not have a very useful range. And glaringly its automated counterpart (AUV's) as
a requisite for SLAM.
