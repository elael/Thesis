Mapping is not a pre-defined concept, there are different ways to think about
mapping, all depends on one's need. The unifying idea is a method to fuse and
represent geometric information about a given environment. Nevertheless, the
meaning of how to represent which information is a consequence of the
application. Here, in this thesis, the objective is to have human-understandable
map yet with a probabilistic interpretation of a 3D environment.
