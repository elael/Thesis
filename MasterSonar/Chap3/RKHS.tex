\section{RKHS - Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space}

A \textit{Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space}, RKHS for short, is a special kind
of Hibert Space of functions where closeness in the sense of the metric is
actual pontwise proximity. That is to say, if two real-valued functions $f$ and
$g$ of a set $\mathcal{X}$ belong to a RKHS $\hs$ ($f,g \in \hs \subset
\mathbb{R}^\mathcal{X}$), then whenever $\hnorm{f-g}$ is small so is
$\norm{f(x)-g(x)}$ for all $x \in \mathcal{X}$.
