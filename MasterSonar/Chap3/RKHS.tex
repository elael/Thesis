\section{RKHS - Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space}

A \textit{Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space}, RKHS for short, is a special kind
of Hibert Space of functions. In a RKHS, closeness in the sense of the metric is
actual pontwise proximity. That is to say, if two real-valued functions $f$ and
$g$ of a (non-empty) set $\mathcal{X}$ belong to a RKHS $\hs$ ($f,g \in \hs
\subset \mathbb{R}^\mathcal{X}$), then whenever $\hnorm{f-g}$ is small so is
$\norm{f(x)-g(x)}$ for all $x \in \mathcal{X}$\cite{berlinet2011reproducing}.

A more formal and useful characterization of a RKHS is consequece of studying
linear operators on Hibert Spaces. The evaluation functional \(\delta_x: \hs \to
\mathbb{R}\), \(\delta_x: f \to f(x)\) is easily seen as such: given \(f,g \in
\hs\) and \(a,b \in \mathbb{R}\), \(\delta_x(af+ag)= (af+ag)(x) = af(x)+ag(x) =
a\delta_x(f)+b\delta_x(g)\). When the evaluation functional is continuous on
$\hs$, $\hs$ is said to be a RKHS.

Riesz representation theorem is an extension, for Hibert Spaces, of the
classical isomorphism between a finite vector space $\mathcal{V}$ and its dual
$\mathcal{V}^*$, the space of linear functions on $\mathcal{V}$. It states that
for every element $\phi \in \hs^*$, where $\hs^*$ is the space
\textit{continuous} linear functionals from $\hs$ into $\mathbb{R}$ (dual
space), there exist a unique $y_\phi \in \hs$, defined by:
\begin{equation}
\phi(x)= \hip{x}{y_\phi}
\end{equation}
